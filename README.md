# Vikram's Mobile Flashcards

This is my Udacity's React Nanodegree project 'Mobile Flashcards' for submission. 

## Short Description

This is an android app that allows user to create decks containing flashcards to practice questions. User can create number of cards with question and answer inside each deck and then take a quiz over those questions to test his knowledge.

This app is developed and tested for android only.

## Brief Instructions

To check out the project:

* Clone the repository
* To install and run the app with 
    - `npm install` or `yarn add`
    - `npm start` or `yarn start`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode with an interactive prompt.

### `npm run android`

Like `npm start`, but attempts to open app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).
